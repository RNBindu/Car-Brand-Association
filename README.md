# Car-Brand-Association
### Introduction:
Understanding how customers perceive and associate a brand with their sentiments is vital for growth in various industries. In this mini project, we have explored associations between luxury car brands discussed on the Edmunds forum and have generated valuable insights into the attributes that customers associate with these brands.

* Dataset:
The data used in this analysis was collected through web scraping from the Edmunds forum.

* Technologies:
The project was developed using Python 3.6.5 and involved the use of similarity measures, various algorithms, lift analysis using similarity measures, and the creation of multidimensional scaling plots.

* Approach:
Our approach consisted of the following key steps:

Data Acquisition: We obtained data through web scraping, gathering discussions and conversations related to luxury car brands.
Data Pre-processing: The collected data underwent pre-processing to clean and prepare it for analysis.
Visualizing Brand Associations: We created a multidimensional scaling plot to visualize the associations between brands.
Identifying Primary Attributes: We determined the primary attributes that customers associate with each brand.
Finding Aspirational Brands: We identified which brand customers aspire to buy based on their discussions.

### Insights:

*We derived insights using two methods: Frequency-Based and Lift-Based.

Frequency-Based Method:
"The brand-word pair most frequently associated is BMW with the word 'Luxury.' This insight reveals that in online discussions, BMW is consistently linked with the term 'Luxury,' reaffirming its perception as a luxury brand among the online audience."

Lift-Based Method:
"The brand-aspirational pair with the highest lift is ('Infiniti', 'Affordable') with a Lift Value of 3.65. This substantial lift value indicates a strong association between the 'Infiniti' brand and the aspirational word 'Affordable.' This insight suggests that 'Infiniti' is perceived as a budget-friendly option among the analyzed brands, presenting a valuable marketing opportunity."

### Key Insights and Actionable Advice:

Brand-Attribute Associations:
The analysis highlights the significance of brand-attribute associations in shaping consumer perceptions. For example, BMW is strongly associated with "Luxury." This association can be leveraged in marketing strategies to solidify BMW's position in the luxury vehicle segment.

Attribute-Centric Marketing:
Brands should focus on their strongest attribute associations when crafting marketing campaigns. For instance, BMW can emphasize its "Performance" and "Luxury" aspects to resonate with consumers who value these features.

Competitor Analysis:
Understanding how competitors are perceived in terms of attribute associations is crucial for differentiation and strengthening brand positioning.

Lift-Based Insights:
Beyond frequency-based insights, lift-based analysis reveals deeper, statistically significant associations. Brands can use these insights to develop unique marketing strategies.

Data-Driven Decision-Making:
This analysis underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in marketing and business strategies.

Customer Engagement:
Engaging with customers in online forums can reinforce positive brand associations and address consumer concerns directly.

Incorporating these insights into their strategies can help the client enhance their brand positioning, refine marketing efforts, and better meet consumer expectations in a competitive automotive market. Both frequency-based and lift-based methods offer unique perspectives, enabling data-driven decisions in a rapidly evolving industry.
